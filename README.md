Part 3 of the Spring 2019 CSC 133 Robot Game project.

*This is a temporary README file*

The goal of this Java project was the understand the many Object-Oriented design patterns and implement them in a working game.

The design patterns that are implemented are:
  - Singleton (PlayerRobot)
  - Command (all files in /Commands)
  - Strategy (NonPlayerRobot)
  - Observer (GameWorld)
  
The player controls a Robot using keyboard hotkeys, with the goal being to reach the final base. 
There are other NonPlayerRobots on the map, each with varying strategies. The strategies can be changed while playing.
